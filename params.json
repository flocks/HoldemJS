In the future, you will be able to compute equities of a whole hand range against another one. \r\n\r\nYou can specify if the two card are suitted or not :\r\n\r\n- AKs for AK suitted\r\n- AKo for AK offsuitted\r\n- AK if you don't care\r\n\r\nExample : \r\n```\r\nDealer.compare(\"AK/TT+\", \"AA\")\r\n```\r\nTT+ for any pair above the pair of Ten.\r\n### Installation\r\n\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nI am the only contributor of this project, so feel free to fork it. I'm pretty sure it is highly improvable. My algorithm is just an approximation of the equities.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nI you have any question, my mail is teissierflorent@gmail.com","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
